#####Diabetes Prediction System 
This project presents a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes based on the analysis of diagnostic measurements. The dataset utilized is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, specifically focusing on females aged at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. The primary objective is to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes through the examination of various medical predictor variables.

__Objective__

The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable prediction model that aids in the early diagnosis of diabetes. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system processes the provided diagnostic measurements to classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.

__About the Dataset Used__

The dataset encompasses critical health metrics, providing a comprehensive view for predictive analysis. The key variables include:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Age

__Outcome:__ 
Target variable indicating diabetes presence (1) or absence (0)

__Results__

The developed Diabetes Prediction System demonstrates promising accuracy and reliability in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes. The model's performance is assessed through rigorous evaluation metrics, providing insights into its strengths and areas for potential improvement.
